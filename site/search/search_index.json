A fellow human being driven by the curiosity to understand the world around me. I'm particularly interested in biomolecules and using different computational tools to study them.</p> <p>I'm a post-doctoral fellow at the Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) Center at the University of Maryland Baltimore with Prof. Alex MacKerell. Here, I optimize lead drug candidates based on their on and off-target effects. I'm also working towards developing better Machine Learning models to predict how drug molecules permeate membranes.</p> <p>Previously, I worked with Prof. Alan Grossfield at the University of Rochester Medical Center towards my doctoral thesis to understand the free energy landscapes of phase separation in lipid bilayers using molecular dynamics simulations enhanced by weighted ensemble techniques.</p> <p>During my grad school, I was fortunate to intern in Moderna twice to understand how lipids and RNA molecules interact from the perspective of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNP) optimization. I was also lucky to help the Moderna team benchmark different binding free-energy calculation tools toward internal goals.</p> <p>Outside the research hours, you can find me hiking in the local state parks, listening to audiobooks, sweating in a HIIT workout, or randomly hopping cafes near me.</p>"},{"location":"cv/","title":"Resume","text":"<p>Download in PDF format  </p>"},{"location":"cv/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Post doctoral fellow skilled in molecular dynamics, modeling, methods development, and computer-aided drug design.

I wanted a purpose for the existence of yet another site in this vast universe of internet. Now I have one. Short answer - Journaling! </p> <p>Long answer - I want to scribble things about my professional and personal journey in a space where I don't have to self-validate with the number of likes, emojis, and comments. For the past year, I successfully built some habits like audiobooks (thanks to my long commute to work), hiking, and investing in other hobbies. I hope this new journaling habit will reinforce them and make me feel accountable. I have been doing another version of journaling through the Daylio App, and the fact that it is still going strong makes me optimistic. Plus, my mental health recently has been enabling me to stick to things that I want.</p> <p>So, in the last week of 2024, as I take a break in southern Maine, this journey begins! ...</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/journaling/","title":"Journaling","text":""}]}
