# About Me

Hi, I'm Ashlin. A fellow human being driven by the curiosity to understand the world around me. I'm particularly interested in biomolecules and using different computational tools to study them.

I'm a post-doctoral fellow at the Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) Center at the University of Maryland Baltimore with Prof. Alex MacKerell. Here, I optimize lead drug candidates based on their on and off-target effects. I'm also working towards developing better Machine Learning models to predict how drug molecules permeate membranes.

Previously, I worked with Prof. Alan Grossfield at the University of Rochester Medical Center towards my doctoral thesis to understand the free energy landscapes of phase separation in lipid bilayers using molecular dynamics simulations enhanced by weighted ensemble techniques.

During my grad school, I was fortunate to intern in Moderna twice to understand how lipids and RNA molecules interact from the perspective of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNP) optimization. I was also lucky to help the Moderna team benchmark different binding free-energy calculation tools toward internal goals.

Outside the research hours, you can find me hiking in the local state parks, listening to audiobooks, sweating in a HIIT workout, or randomly hopping cafes near me.
