Here is a brief fun explanation of WE.</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine the configurational space of a system you want to explore is like Mario world.</p> <p>A lot of cool features (configs), and ideally, you want to capture all of them to get a more complete statistical understanding.</p> <p></p> <p>In most cases, you know about states A and B of the system and are interested in the transition between these states.</p> <p>Ex: You have a protein in open and closed conformations and want to know how it happens.</p> <p></p> <p>If you contact a simulation person, they will suggest Molecular Dynamics (MD). </p> <p>You can consider the standard MD as a single-player Mario game\ud83c\udfae</p> <p></p> <p>Here, the Mario, a single-long MD trajectory, starts from state A and explores the local configs.</p> <p>Because of some barrier \ud83d\udea7, Mario may not reach state B. Making this a rare event in the simulation time scale.</p> <p>Sometimes, Mario is lucky and reaches state B just ONCE.</p> <p>Now if you plot the probability distribution of Mario in Mario World, you get different results depending on where Mario started.</p> <p>And most of the time, this does not agree with our intuition/experimental data\ud83e\uddeabecause our Mario has yet to explore the entire Mario world.</p> <p>Our barrier estimation is likely erroneous since Mario jumped over it just once after running  \ud83d\udcbb for months</p> <p>(We need to roll the die \ud83c\udfb2multiple times to get an average value - not once)</p> <p>So, we need a method that facilitates multiple jumps back and forth between states</p> <p>Now, enter the Weighted Ensemble!</p> <p>A multiplayer game\ud83c\udfae\ud83c\udfae\ud83c\udfae\ud83c\udfae!</p> <p></p> <p>First, we bin the Mario world\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f. </p> <p>The idea is to let multiple Marios explore each bin systematically and efficiently.</p> <p>But we have a few design choices to make\ud83e\udd14 </p> <p>How many Marios can I afford to explore a bin?</p> <p>If you are a broke undergrad student who can afford a laptop, let's say 2 for this explanation.</p> <p>But the strategy is scalable.</p> <p>Now, we place a Mario in a bin with Probability = 1.</p> <p>Since we need two Marios per bin, we spawn another Mario and split the parent Mario's Probability to child Marios (0.5 each)</p> <p>This is the WE stage \ud83c\udfb2.</p> <p>Now we let the Marios run wild (MD stage \u23f1\ufe0f), and as a result, one Mario stays in the old bin, and the other finds a new bin. </p> <p>The Marios splits again whenever we have a new or underexplored bin (less than 2 Marios per bin)</p> <p>(WE stage\ud83c\udfb2)</p> <p>Again, we let Mario run wild (MD stage\u23f1\ufe0f)</p> <p>Oops!

Most of my review includes my take and a few points discussed in our book club. The book portrays the determination and vision of newly liberated Black Americans during Reconstruction. The role of the community they developed and how it shaped the history of the USA.</p> <p>This graphical non-fiction work takes a different route than the normal academic supplements by effectively utilizing excerpts from personal letters, public speeches, news articles, academic journals, etc. The best part? The reader does not have to scroll the vast internet to see the references used. A large portion of the non-graphical part of the book is dedicated to actual excerpts for the readers. But again, I was curious and went inside a rabbit hole of references given as footnotes of these excerpts.</p> <p>There was a nice discussion in our reading club regarding the relevance of this book as an academic instrument. Though everyone agreed on the accessibility window this book opens to many young readers with low attention spans, one drawback people pointed out was the fewer data being discussed or picturized. As the title suggests, the book really focuses on the DC-Maryland-Virginia (DMV) region and does a take on what it is to live like a Black American in this region while the country just got out of a civil war; a new horizon opens up filled with hope and uncertainty in a society slowly refusing their dark norms.</p> <p>Most senior book club members pointed out how they have been taught about the reconstruction period in their high schools from the 40s to the 80s. One member who had a New York high school education in the 70s remembered how they were taught that Reconstruction was a failure or a mistake. Another member who had schooling in North Carolina around a similar period was taught along the direction of this book. The latter pointed out that this difference is strange, given how these states aligned during the civil war. Other senior members remembered the whole notion of civil war taught in southern schools from the perspective of how a federal system can overshadow state rights, and the aspect of slavery was totally omitted in their curriculum.</p> <p>Along this line, I would love to share a resource that was brought to our book club: lesson plans to consider how history is taught today compared to when we were in high school. UNC Press lesson plans for AP high school history course.</p> <p>The book club members also discussed the disrespectful references made by the racists towards Black Americans, White people who migrated from south to north, and vice versa. How these people who fled were treated as not loyal to a side. There was a nice discussion about different forms of slavery around the world, ranging from Black Americans to Royal concubines in Ottoman Imperial Harem that happened in a similar period - How slavery was different in supporting the politics, economics, etc., and how the people who were oppressed had different social \"security\" nets that were keeping them in that strata.</p> <p>Personally, I think this graphical work is relevant as an academic tool. I remember how my Roman Catholic parents and the Sunday school teachers always wanted me to read the whole bible, and I refused to read that heavy of text. However, on seeing a graphic Old Testament version in one of my friend's hands, I borrowed it for a week. I inhaled it without hesitation, simply out of curiosity. People like me, who are distracted and discouraged by piles of historical references, can easily access an introduction to the Reconstruction era.</p> <p>Plus, I firmly believe that an academic tool should incite more curiosity for a student to ponder more about the subject on their own. I was looking for an introduction and to dive into depths but ended up with more questions than I had planned for. How did a group come together for a greater cause to rise above the cultural norms and treat everyone as equals? (I get the moral and civic aspect but was curious about the political ambitions of each side). Then, within a few decades, it propelled the society by introducing the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, leading to emancipation, citizenship, and the right to vote. After which, the steam ran out (or did it?). What made them come together, coexist, build communities, and drive away from some regions in the DMV area. This book gives a brief introduction and moves on.</p> <p>I enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to a friend.</p> <p>More resources to enjoy: </p> <ol> <li>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl - by Harriet Jacobs</li> <li>Memories of an Arabian Princess - by Emily Ruete</li> <li>The Economics of Slavery: And Other Studies in Econometric History - by John R.

Barry</p> <p>Simon and Schuster edition</p> <p>This book was chosen for our History book club's February-March reading. Most of my review includes my take and a few points discussed in our book club.</p> <p>The first thing that crossed my mind was the remarkable similarities of man-made disasters[1] being created because of the chasm between the Scientists/Researchers/Engineers and the policymakers. Given the response to the recent global pandemic from the public, policymakers, scientists, and people in power, this book shows that history is doomed to repeat if we don't learn from it. (Interestingly the author has written another best seller \"The Great Influenza\" - Now on my wish list). Everyone in the book club was sad about the current US political climate, where this chasm is again expected to widen intentionally.</p> <p>Another fun rabbit hole was (1) the mud volcanoes/vents in the Mississippi River at the time, which can harm the ships, and are somewhat unique to this river. (2) There are parts of the river that are below sea level, so the water in the river bottom does not desire to flow but the top part wants to due to inertia and drags it (Alright! This is an oversimplification, the process is more complicated). (3) The sheer volume of water and sediment displacement this river handles and (4) the human attempts to contain it throughout history.</p> <p>A few of the book club members who are US citizens and have lived a considerable amount of time in the US exclaimed that the story of Greenville was unknown to them before this book, despite their visits to Louisiana and particularly New Orleans. As a foreigner, I was scratching my head as, to why this book was locked in a small location called Greenville, given the vast basins of Mississippi spanning several US states. The book later justifies this choice by explaining the unique political, economic, and social landscape this small city held while witnessing the single greatest levee crevasse during the 1927 flood season. </p> <p>It was also interesting to read about the economic rivalry that prevailed between New Orleans and Chicago that shaped their culture including music. The silence of the press in warning people while intentionally flooding parishes to save the city of New Orleans. The skewed thought process and lobbying in choosing one over the other. How certain people were allowed to escape while others were forced to stay. How a great flood in Mississippi changed not just the delta and the people living there but the secretary of commerce into a president. This book does a remarkable job of connecting pieces and giving a quick panoramic view across history, people, culture, economy, and politics.</p> <p>I felt this book goes hand in hand with another book that I skimmed through - The Great Displacement (by Jake Bittle), which covers the human side of ecological disasters as the climate change starts to grip us tighter. </p> <p>[1] A bookclub member pointed out the absence of women in this book in key roles</p>"},{"location":"Misc/2025/04/09/the-cold-war---book-review/","title":"The Cold War - Book Review","text":"<p>A New History</p> <p>By John Lewis Gaddis</p> <p>Penguin Books</p> <p>This book was chosen for our History book club's April reading. Most of my review includes my take and a few points discussed in our book club.A context added by one of the book club members was this is a distilled version of a much more elaborate and earlier work of the author \u00a0- We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History. As I have finished the former, I'm very much tempted to give the latter a try.</p> <p>The book neatly covers the Cold War geo-political landscapes predominantly from a USA-centric view and sometimes from a USSR perspective. Given the large scope of this book elaborating on the NATO and WARSAW measures that happened during the Cold War, given the changing political climate in the USA and USSR at those times, it makes sense why other large players like the UK, France, and China got a little screen time. The Non-Aligned Movement folks do get guest appearances as well.</p> <p>There are several aspects that the book introduced me to: (1) How clueless were most of the leaders at the time (USA, France, China) about what students were capable of - Something that might have happened when the global phenomena of baby boomers got more accessibility to higher education after the World War 2, resources to disseminate their ideas in University Campuses and to unite for common causes they believe that's worth fighting for rather than being pawns of someone else's plans. The reaction to this new threat by different leaders is different - some fled, some suppressed it by all means, and some had to change their policy accordingly. Interestingly, all these reactions might have been motivated by the government architecture in these countries and the freedom and flexibility the corresponding leaders enjoyed at the top. Along similar lines, one notable area this book has attempted to cover is the psychology of the leaders and how it might have played out for them.</p> <p>(2) The reactions of nations other than the US and USSR - While the world was in a tug of war politically and tension remained tight, the rest of the countries also had to react to this, either by choosing sides or not. It is remarkable how different nations worked this out, who wanted to preserve their identity. For example, the actions of the UK and France, weakening colonial powerhouses, during the Suez Canal Crisis, the closest NATO come to falling apart. On the other hand, how this played out for new political dynamics in the Middle East. Interestingly, this was also a reminder for the rest of the world, how one can benefit without joining sides by Nasser, as a strong proponent of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Some NAM leaders, like Titto, showed how they can set aside their personal beliefs and stand out for their nation's good. At the end of the day, even nations under the banner of NATO and WARSAW wanted to be dependent ally rather than an obedient one.</p> <p>(3) The rise of proxy wars, where 2 parties get into an armed conflict, quickly backed up by bigger players to supply resources that the original parties could not even fathom. Again, this conflict now starts to take more time, money, and losses as the bigger players treat it as a showdown of their might. As the original parties often take the hit or a power vacuum that usually gets filled by something worse, or becomes severely in debt, the bigger players still have a home they can go back to and tell the tale. It was interesting to read this book and get a notification of Johnny Harris's new YouTube upload about the same topic.</p> <p>(4) The shifting dynamics of nuclear weapons as a weapon and a deterrent - The book briefly talks about the view the leaders of the rest of the nations had about nuclear arms- Was the arms race necessary when everyone was fully aware of the aftermath if used in a war? However, the book covered in detail how this viewpoint evolved in the USA as a function of leaders in Whitehouse. To be honest, this felt like a good overview of other Cold War political events that shaped the current USA, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, Space Wars, Intelligence and counterintelligence efforts, and other internal events. How two major powerhouses boasted about their capabilities, though the book clearly points out how poor the intelligence they possessed about each other was at the time. This led us to a fun discussion about the International Spy Museum (Now on my bucket list to visit).</p> <p>One book club member had an excellent remark about the old joke about the USSR which is eerily becoming true these days in different contexts: How it is easier to predict the future than the past.</p>"},{"location":"Misc/2024/12/31/the-journaling-saga-begins/","title":"The Journaling Saga Begins!","text":"<p>For a long time, I procrastinated on having a personal website.

It is worth every penny (despite the initial money overhead to invest in your gear - trust me, do not cheap out to save a few bucks, your life might depend on it - Balancing the budget and quality is the key thing). </p> <p>Please go through their Student handbook and gear list to prepare. Usually, the application starts in late October or early November. Please follow their Facebook or other social media platforms for this.</p> <p>The instructors were fantastic, the trip was excellent and I had a 10-star experience.</p> <p>This write-up is about my experience as an ADK Winter Mountaineering School student in the \"Combo section\" (Day Hike + Backcountry/Backpacking)</p>"},{"location":"Misc/2025/02/07/winter-mountaineering---part-2-take-home-messages-from-the-wms/#day-1-check-in-and-self-arrest-training","title":"Day 1 \u00a0- Check-in and Self-Arrest Training","text":"<p>The day started with the intense gear check. Some of us realized that the microspikes that we bought for crampons were not \"the crampons\" needed for hard ice navigation. The two-hour break between the gear check and training gave us ample time to go for last-minute shopping to purchase the REAL crampons from Lake Placid. While shopping for an ear buff, I found a nice puffy jacket that was on sale at EMS. I wish I did more shopping here in the valley than online (but there's no guarantee). The local clerks were terrain and weather experts and gave really useful tips. Plus, all of them were extremely nice to us and did not take advantage of our urgency.</p> <p>If you want to read more about Self-Arrest principles, American Alpine Club has an amazing article here.</p> Rolling down the hills to self-arrest (Video courtesy: Gary) <p>After the tiring but fun hours of rolling down the hill, we had an amazing dinner prepared by the lovely ADK Loj crew. Then there were two presentations - Winter Mountaineering 101 and Meal Prep.</p> Night presentations in the Education Yurt (Photo courtesy: Gary) <p>Here, I will write things about what stuck with me most - this is in no way a comprehensive or exhaustive list of things you should know before starting climbing one fine winter morning - Please do your research and consult experts (I'm just a random dude on the internet - Trust me!)</p> <ol> <li>Pick of the ice axe always point towards your pinky to self-arrest.</li> <li>Temperature control: Always make sure we are dry and comfy. Your temperature should dictate your speed - Too sweaty? Loosen up layers and go slow. Too cold? Layer up and go fast. The idea is to have an equilibrium and not to go to extremes.</li> <li>Getting back home is essential, summiting a peak is a bonus.</li> <li>After hiking (This is especially true for back-packing folks): Your meal should be mentally rewarding and you should be looking forward to the warm meal (Don't be like me who regretted bringing Ramen for one of the backpacking nights and crunched half cooked Ramen). Find what gets you excited about food. Try to reflect those in your meal prep. Test your food at least once in your comfy home. If you hate it at home on your couch, chances are you still hate it after a strenuous hike in a cold Lean-to after freezing rain (For example, peanut butter in your oatmeal mix at room temperature might sound delicious, but at -10\u00b0F, it tastes and feels like brick).</li> <li>After every hike, ask yourself - What could be improved? Then revise. This is supposed to be fun and not torture.</li> <li>Look out for Lemons - The rule of thumb is having 3 lemons is a sign for the whole party to turn around and come back another time (This was a solid metaphor that came from ADK instructors).</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Misc/2025/02/07/winter-mountaineering---part-2-take-home-messages-from-the-wms/#day-2-shake-down-day-to-crows-big-crow-and-little-crow-more-useful-talks","title":"Day 2 (Shake-down day - To Crows (Big Crow and Little Crow) + More useful talks)","text":"<p>Backward Trip planning: (Assuming you have already done research about the trail that you are aiming for - Including if it is open, weather (not at the trailhead but at the summit too), difficulty, trail conditions, etc)</p> <ol> <li>When does the party want to get back to the starting point (Your home, Airbnb, Hotel - Not the trailhead)</li> <li>Check the travel time to the trailhead (back and forth) + Carpooling discussion</li> <li>Set up the turn-around time - This is a golden rule.
